## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. If you are interested in contributing, you may be required to sign a one-time Contributor License Agreement (CLA) granting Microsoft the rights to use your contribution(s). For details, please visit <https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to sign a CLA or not. If your signature is needed, the bot will decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., with a status check and a link to accept the agreement). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot to complete your CLA signature. You will only need to do this once across all repos that use our CLA.
