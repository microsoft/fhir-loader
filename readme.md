# FHIR Bulk Loader

FHIR Bulk Loader is an Azure Function App solution that provides the following services for ingesting FHIR Resources into the FHIR Server:
 + Imports FHIR Bundles (compressed and non-compressed) and NDJSON files into FHIR Server 
 + High Speed Parallel Event Grid triggers from storage accounts or other event grid resources.
 + Complete Auditing, Error logging and Retry for throttled transactions 

# Architecture Overview
![Bulk Loader](docs/images/architecture/bulkloadarch.png)

# Prerequsites
1. The FHIR Loader requires the following compoentns 
   + an API for FHIR Service or OSS FHIR Server
   + the Microsoft FHIR Proxy (with Keyvault)

1. The following resources providers must be registered in your subscription and you must have the ability to create/update them:
   + ResourceGroup
   + Storage Account 
   + App Service Plan 
   + Function App 
   + EventGrid

2. You must have the policy assigned to read/write KeyVault Secrets in the specified Key Vault.

# Deployment
1. [Open Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) you can also access this from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select Bash Shell for the environment 
3. Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-loader```
4. Execute ```deploybulkloader.bash``` for direct FHIR Server access or ```deploybulkloader.bash -y``` to use FHIR Proxy access

Detailed instructions can be found [here](docs/deployment.md)

# Importing FHIR Data
The containers for importing data are created during deployment.  Containers are created by input file type
- for FHIR Bundles (transactional or batch), use the "bundles" container
- for NDJSON formated FHIR Bunldles use the "ndjson" container
- for Compressed (zip) formatted FHIR Bundles, use the "zip" container

Detailed instructions can be found [here](docs/deployment.md) 

# Performance 
The FHIR Loader deploys with a Standard App Service plan that can support tens of thousands file imports per hour.  During testing we have been able to scale the FHIR Loader performance to hundreds of thousands of files per hour.  

Note:  Scaling to hundreds of thousands of files per hour requires additional scaling on the FHIR API to handle the incoming messages.  High rates of 429's at the API or Cosmos data plane indicate that additional scaling is necessary. 

Detailed performance guidelines can be found [here](docs/performance.md)
